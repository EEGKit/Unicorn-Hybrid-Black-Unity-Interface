# Unicorn Hybrid Black Unity Interface
Welcome to the Unicorn Unity package! This package provides a comprehensive toolkit SDK for integrating brain-computer interface (BCI) technology with Unity. With the use of Unicorn Hybrid Black, this enabling the creation of immersive and interactive experiences (2D, 3D, VR or AR) driven by Electroencephalography (EEG). 

Our package is designed to be developer-friendly and requires no prior knowledge of EEG data processing or data analysis skills. Whether you are developing games, therapeutic applications, or research tools, our package simplifies the process of leveraging EEG data in real-time.

For experienced Neuro-science resarchers, we also provide an option to log EEG data during the gameplay for post-analysis, allowing for deeper insights and research opportunities.

Features:
- Easy Integration: Seamlessly integrate BCI with your existing Unity projects.
- Real-time Processing: Efficiently process EEG signals with built-in algorithms.
- Interactive Examples: Ready-to-use examples to get you started quickly. 
- Data Logging: Option to log EEG data for post-analysis by experienced researchers.
- Community Support: Active community for troubleshooting.
